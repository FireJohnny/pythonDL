Installation
-------------

pythonDL depends on Python 2.7, the latest release as of May 1 2013 being
Python 2.7.4, available at http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.4/

pythonDL also depends on pyparsing, available at http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/

Please install pyparsing and ensure it is on the path.


Usage
-------

An example usage is given in demoscript.py

In general import the modules, parse text or other data, and perform queries
on the parsed data

To get a feel for what's available, try executing something similar to demoscript.py interactively:
open the python interpreter, import the modules, and experiment with the available functions. 
If instead you wish to see some pre-written tests, the simplestructuralsubsumption.py and 
textexpressionparser.py files can be run as standalone scripts, and will demonstrate some
examples.
